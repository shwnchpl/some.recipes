## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour (bread or AP)
- 1 cups plain Greek yogurt (any fat content)
- 1T baking powder
- 1/2t kosher salt
- Olive oil

## Process

Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add yogurt and knead by hand for
15-20 minutes, until dough passes the window pane test. Coat in olive oil and
allow to rest for five minutes before stretching, topping, bake on the bottom
rack of an oven preheated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit for 12-15 minutes, until
crust is crispy and brown.

## Notes

For someone who has never had this dough, the best way I can think of
describing it is "better than you would ever expect." The yogurt gives the
dough a tanginess that is not quite the same as a well developed yeast flavor
profile, but is, nevertheless, in the same wheelhouse. The end product is a bit
cakey and rich, but not in a bad way&mdash;think the kind of dough on which you
might like to make a good old fashioned gas station cheeseburger pizza.

If you need a pizza dough to be ready in under a half hour, this is the option.
Bakes very well in a deep pan.
