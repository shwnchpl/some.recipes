## Ingredients

- 56oz San Marzano tomatoes with liquid (2 28oz cans)
- 2C water
- 0.25C olive oil
- 2 medium onions
- 2 medium carrots
- 3 large ribs of celery
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 6-8 large cloves of garlic, pressed
- 2T double concentrated tomato paste
- 2T chopped "Italian" flat-leaf parsley
- 0.5T "Italian" herbs (dried or fresh)
- 1t anchovy paste
- 0.5t kosher salt
- 0.5t crushed red pepper
- 0.5t dried oregano
- 0.5t cracked black pepper

## Process

Grate onions, carrots, and celery. Bring olive oil to medium-low heat in
a large saucepan. Add red and black pepper, oregano, and anchovy paste.
Cook, stirring periodically, until fragrant or for about 1 minute. Add
tomato paste and crushed garlic. Stir into oil and allow to cook for at
least 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Add grated vegetables and salt and
cook over medium low heat, stirring periodically, for at least 20
minutes, until smell/flavor is nutty and a fond has begun to form.

Meanwhile, using clean hands crush tomatoes in their juices. Deglaze pan
with lemon juice and add crushed tomatoes, parsley, and Italian herbs.
Add water to the cans and/or other vessels the tomatoes were in and add
this water. Partially cover and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce to low
heat and allow to simmer for at least 2 hours, or until desired
flavor/consistency is reached.

## Notes

My take on Italian-American "marinara" sauce. Works great as a base
sauce for other dinners throughout the week. Add a bit of sugar for a
pizza sauce. Add seared Italian sausage and simmer for another couple of
hours for Italian sausage spaghetti sauce. I find that grating the
vegetables, while laborious, produces a final product where the
"chunkiness" of the sauce comes from rich tomatoes, not pieces of spent
onion and celery whose flavors have been well extracted over a period of
hours.

If you want to add fresh basil to the sauce (in addition to any that
might be included in your "Italian herbs"), I recommend adding it around
ten minutes before the end of the simmering process, or even just when
reheating.

It's certainly possible to substitute a bit of white wine (around 0.25C)
or even a thematic vinegar (such as white wine vinegar or white balsamic
vinegar) for the lemon juice, but I find the lemon juice adds a nice
brightness to the dish. It's also possible to leave out the anchovy
paste (if you don't eat fish or you find anchovies disgusting); if I
were going to do so I would add another 0.25t of salt to balance out the
saltiness. I will say, if you aren't opposed to eating fish for dietary
reasons, the anchovies *do* add a very nice blast of umami and *do not*
taste anything like anchovies/fish in the final product.

On the topic of salt, I tend to under season sauces/soups so they can be
paired with other salty ingredients without producing a meal that is
ridiculously salty. For instance, the quantities in this recipe produce
about 14 0.5C servings. When using my preferred brand of San Marzano
tomatoes, tomato paste, and anchovy paste (which is Cento in all three
cases), each portion which contains around 65 calories, 3.9g of fat
(0.5g saturated fat), and about 125mg of sodium (or about 5% fat, 2.5%
saturated fat, and 5.5%, for those who think in terms of [FDA percent
daily values]). In terms of calories and fat, these numbers are
comparable to most store-bought "marinara," but this is considerably
less salt than I have typically found (around 3-4 times less).

I think there are a variety of reasons why store bought sauces contain
more salt (for instance, shelf stability, or the fact that salty food
tastes good), but when I'm constructing a meal that I want to leave me
feeling satiated but not "salted out," I tend to look at the big
picture. This means I would rather add a bit of extra salt to a sauce
like this if I'm just serving it with vegetables over spaghetti than
have my meatball sub contain more sodium than I'm supposed to consume in
an entire day.

Part of the appeal of making a sauce like this from scratch in the first
place is greater control, so obviously if you would rather have a
saltier sauce then by all means, go for it.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
