## Ingredients

- 5 cups AP flour
- 2 cups warm water
- 0.25 cups white sugar
- 1.5T active dry yeast
- 1T salt
- 2T oil + more for hands
- 12-16 sausages/hot dogs

## Process

Whisk together sugar, water, and yeast. Bloom for 5-10 minutes. Whisk together
flour and salt. Add 2T of oil to wet mixture, whisk, then add flour and stir
with a wooden spoon. Cover hands in oil and knead dough for around 5 minutes
until very stretchy and sticky. Let rest for 5 minutes.

Portion and wrap sausages/dogs. It should be possible to stretch and flatten
the dough by hand&mdash;no need for rolling pin. Let rise for 20ish minutes,
until approximately doubled, then bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 20-25
minutes, until golden brown and delicious.

## Notes

This recipe is my attempt to recreate the pigs in a blanket they served for
lunch at my elementary school. A lot of pigs in a blanket recipes call for puff
pastry dough, croissant dough, or another high fat dough in that genre. Aside
from the fact that I find this type of dough to be a bit rich when paired with
sausages, it just isn't what I ate growing up.

Instead, the pigs in a blanket I remember have a bready, yeast-risen,
pizza-dough-like quality. The goal here is something almost calzone-esque on
the outside, but that (thanks to to the sausage/hot dog) becomes almost
dumpling gooey on the inside. I like to use Hebrew National all beef knockwurst
(which most certainly is not what they fed us when I was growing up), but this
recipe is more about dough than dog, so you do you.

For bonus points, serve with macaroni salad, baked beans, and a tiny carton of
chocolate milk, or something like that. Now, as Mrs. Clifford used to say, less
talking, more eating!
