## Ingredients

#### Rice
- 5 cups boiling water
- 550g (about 3 cups) Basmati rice
- 1lb browned ground beef
- 250g (about 1.5 cups) fresh blanched or defrosted frozen peas
- 0.5 cups caramelized onions (see below)
- 50g roasted cashews (see below)
- 40g rehydrated raisins in liquid (see below)
- 2T olive oil
- 2t coriander
- 1.5t cumin
- 1.5t cinnamon
- 0.75t Hungarian paprika
- 0.5t turmeric
- 0.25t fresh cracked black pepper
- 0.25t chipotle chili powder
- Kosher salt
- Cottage cheese (optional)

#### Caramelized Onions
- 2 large onions, sliced very thinly
- 2T teaspoon sunflower seed oil
- Kosher salt

#### Roasted Cashews
- 50g blanched unsalted cashews
- 1t sunflower seed oil
- Kosher salt

#### Rehydrated Raisins
- 40g raisins
- 50ml boiling water
- 0.5t Sicilian lemon white balsamic vinegar
- 1 small pinch (around 10-15 strands) saffron

## Process

Mix raisins, saffron, and vinegar in a bowl and cover with 50ml boiling water.
Let sit for at least a half hour. Meanwhile, slice two onions very thinly,
salt, and let sit for at least ten minutes. Meanwhile, add 1 teaspoon of
sunflower oil to a non-stick pan and carefully toast cashews until golden
brown. Allow to cool, chop coarsely, and reserve.

Heat two tablespoons of sunflower oil in a steel pan and add onions. Caramelize
over medium-low heat for at least a half hour and up to an hour, depending on
taste, deglazing with about three tablespoons of luke cold water ever five
minutes after the first fifteen minutes, or whenever a brown fond begins to
cover most of the bottom of the pan. When onions are done, reserve.

Salt and brown ground beef, drain oil, and set aside.

Add two tablespoons of olive oil to a large pot on medium low heat. Toast
remaining spices in oil until fragrant. Add rice directly to oil (do not rinse
rice first) and toast for a few minutes until also fragrant. Stir in
caramelized onions and cashews, then raisins, then peas, then finally ground
beef, ensuring all ingredients are well incorporated. Finally, add boiling
water, raise heat to high until water is nearly at a rolling boil, cover, and
simmer over low heat without removing cover for twenty minutes. After twenty
minutes, remove from heat and let sit for at least ten and no more than twenty
minutes without removing cover.

Fluff with fork, add additional salt to taste, and serve immediately.
Optionally top with cottage cheese when serving. Would also likely go well with
nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom, as well as a bay leaf, and garnish well with flat
leaf parsley and/or fresh dill.
