## Ingredients

- 1lb 90% lean ground beef
- 0.5 cups diced onions
- 0.5 cups panko bread crumbs
- 0.25 cups + 1T (2.5oz) red wine
- 2.25oz drained sliced black olives (1 small can)
- 0.25 cups "Italian style" tomato sauce
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 4-6 large cloves of fresh garlic, pressed
- 1T chopped fresh "Italian" herbs
- 1t garlic powder
- 1t dried oregano
- 1t cracked black pepper
- 0.5t crushed red pepper
- 0.5t hot sauce

## Process

Add breadcrumbs, dried herbs and spices, wine, and tomato sauce to a
small bowl. Stir well and let liquid absorb for at least 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and combine all other
ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add soaked breadcrumbs and mix by hand
until everything is well incorporated and mixture is relatively
homogeneous. Form into four equally sized patties.

Bake on a non-stick baking sheet for about 20 minutes, or until internal
temperature reaches approximately 160 degrees Fahrenheit (or desired
doneness).

## Notes

I think my favorite meatloaf application is the leftover meatloaf
sandwich (a hearty slab of meatloaf reheated in tomato sauce with a nice
slice of cheese, maybe provolone, melted on top, served on a simple
store-bought bun). Recently I decided to just cut to the chase and bake
a "meatloaf" in the patty form factor directly. This definitely worked.

The above ratios would almost certainly work just as well for a larger
"Italian style" meatloaf (please don't hurt me pedantic Italian Food
Twitter&mdash;I know this almost certainly isn't *real* Italian food);
just form into one big loaf and adjust baking time as necessary.

By a "non-stick baking sheet," I mean a normal baking sheet that has
been made to be non-stick in some way (by greasing, spraying with a
non-stick spray, topping with a silicon mat, etc.). By "Italian" herbs I
mean flat leaf parsley, basil, oregano, and/or other herbs in that
genre.

I didn't feel like making tomato sauce from scratch when I made this, so
I used Ragu Chunky "Garden Combination," which seemed to work well
enough for my purposes.

Finally, instead of (or in addition to) garlic powder, dried minced
garlic works very well.
