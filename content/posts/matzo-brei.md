## Ingredients

- 2 medium eggs
- 1 matzo (unsalted or lightly salted)
- 1T butter
- Kosher salt

## Process

Beat eggs with a fork until bright yellow and homogeneous but not aerated.
Break matzo into irregular small to medium sized pieces, ranging in size from
approximately one to four square inches. Soak matzo in beaten eggs for three to
five minutes, until barely soggy.

Melt butter in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add matzo and egg mixture and
let fry for around fifteen seconds without agitating. Season with salt (no salt
should have been added before this point) and gently scramble. Alternate
between allowing eggs to cook and gently scrambling until the desired level of
doneness is achieved.

Serve plain, with fresh cracked black pepper, additional butter, fried onions,
or sour cream for a savory matzo brei. For a sweeter matzo brei, serve with
fruit jam, honey, or maple syrup.

## Notes

When it comes to choosing a matzo brand for this recipe (and in general), I
prefer Yehuda or Streit's over Manischewitz matzos, which I find to be a bit
dry and bland.

Many people prepare matzos for matzo brei by rinsing or briefly soaking them in
hot water, before or after breaking them into pieces. While this is how my
mother always made matzo brei when I was growing up, I find I prefer to simply
soak the matzos in beaten eggs as this yields a slightly richer and more
toothsome final product.
