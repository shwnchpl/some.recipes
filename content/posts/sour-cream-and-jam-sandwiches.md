## Ingredients

- 1 plain white hamburger bun
- 2T raspberry jam
- 2T sour cream

## Process

Apply sour cream to one side of bun and raspberry jam to the other. Serve
immediately.

## Notes

It is absolutely absurd how delicious this is. It's painfully hot in my
apartment today, so for "dinner" I decided to put what I perceived to be
the coolest things in the refrigerator together into a sandwich. After
one bite, I immediately knew a second sandwich would be happening, and
it did.

The tanginess of the sour cream mixed with the sweetness of the jelly,
all bound together on a cheap, soft, doughy bun ends up tasting almost
like some kind of beautiful hybrid between the kind of strawberry and
whipped cream sandwiches you see for sale at convenience stores in Japan
and a jam filled Berliner/Pfannkuchen or raspberry bismark.

Use however much jam and sour cream you like, just keep the SC to J
ratio about equal and you'll be on cruise control to ~~cool~~
deliciousness.
