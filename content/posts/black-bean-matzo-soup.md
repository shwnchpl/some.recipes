## Ingredients

- 150g cooked black beans.
- 2t olive oil
- 1T butter or light butter/margarine
- 1 matzo (an unsalted egg matzo works very well)
- Garlic powder
- Kosher salt

## Process

If beans are canned, rinse well. Add to pan with olive oil. Bring to sizzle
over medium heat and fry for a couple of minutes. Add a bit of salt and garlic
powder to taste. Add just enough water to half cover the beans and raise heat
to medium high. Allow water to boil off. Add more water and mash beans. Repeat
this process two or three times then let the beans boil down once more and add
around a half cup of water. While bringing to a boil, crush the matzo into the
bean mixture, then mash well. Salt to taste, remove from heat, add butter and
serve immediately.

The quantities listed above make one portion, about 400 calories depending on
fat used. A can of black beans would probably be good for 3-4 portions and
require around 3 sheets of matzo to achieve the same consistency.
