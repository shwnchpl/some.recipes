Let me just start by saying I can't believe this domain name wasn't taken.

More to the point, this website is a collection of recipes (get it?  _some
recipies_) that I have discovered, developed, altered, co-opted, or otherwise
can't find anywhere else and want to be able to make again.  I can't promise
you'll like all of these concoctions, but I can promise that I do, otherwise I
wouldn't post them.  No comments on here for now, but if you have any thoughts
please do feel free to reach out via Twitter, email, or other social media (you
can find me, I'm around).

A bit about myself: in addition to recipes, I write code and poetry (I'll let
you guess which one pays the bills).  I'm a fan of New York City, Tokyo, Julio
Cort√°zar, Charisma.com, French onion dip, Jean-Luc Godard, GNU/Linux, open
source software, and Frank O'Hara, amongst other things.  I am the polar
opposite of a picky eater, nor am I  a culinary classist---foie gras is
delicious but so is Land O'Lakes American cheese.  Go right ahead and @ me.

Some of my favorite foods include eggplant parmesan, New York style pizza,
grilled cheese, smashed burgers, okonomiyaki, lentil soup, Crunchy Cheez
Doodles, hot wings, breakfast sandwiches, bagels and cream cheese, refried
beans, braised short ribs, a nice beer, matzo brei, spaghetti (with red sauce
or even just olive oil), and Italian subs.
